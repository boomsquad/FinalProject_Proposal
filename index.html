            3. The user will see a webpage that will have an even amount of "cards" that the user can click 
                on. Once clicked the "card" will reveal what is underneath. We are hoping to implement a way 
                where when two matching cards are clicked in a row they will give you points.

            4. The majority of it will be done in javascript along side html for the visuals. It will be 
                uploaded to github and hosted on azure.
